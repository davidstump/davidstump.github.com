**Happy Blizzard 2012!**

It's not quite New Year's Eve, however, I thought I would get a jump start on a resolution early this year. The resolution idea comes from my awesome co-workers at [Littlelines](http://littlelines.com) who each mentioned re-starting their blog presence and making an effort to write and share more in 2013. I love the developer community [specifically the Ruby/Rails community as of late] and the ease/effort with which help, advice, problems and solutions are shared and discussed. For this new year, I am planning to make a concerted effort to write, share and help the community that has helped in uncountable ways getting me where I am today [which is a pretty fantastic happy place!]. 

Perhaps this sentimental resolution is partially a result of a bit too much holiday cheer [by way of food, presents, family and one midwest blizzard], but a little more cheer throughout the non-holiday months couldn't hurt anyone, right?

With that, I hope everyone had a relaxing holiday break and is pumped to start a brand new 2013 in a few days. Also, keep and eye out for some exciting Dayton Ruby Community news in the near future!!

**Cheers!**
